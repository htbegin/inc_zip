# project: incremental zip backup and restore tool

## general instruction

- use git to track each update and write a clear commit message for the update
- ensure pytest still succeeds after each update
- use pylint to ensure the code style is consistent

## performance is important

- consider the possible ways to speed up the backup and the restore procedure
